# 🚗 Drive Sense – Arduino-Based ACC & AEB  

**Drive Sense** is an Arduino-based **driver assistance system** implementing:  
- **Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)** – Adjusts vehicle speed based on the rate of approach to the front object.  
- **Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB)** – Automatically applies brakes if a rest object is detected.  

## 🛠 Features  
✅ **Sonar sensor-based distance monitoring** – Measures the **rate of change of distance** between the user's car and the front object.  
✅ **IR sensor-based RPM meter** – Measures the **speed of the user's car** for ACC and AEB decision-making.  
✅ **Real-time obstacle detection** – Ensures safe braking when necessary.  
✅ **Arduino-controlled automation** – Low-cost and efficient implementation.  

## 🔧 Hardware Requirements  
- **Arduino Board** (Uno/Nano)  
- **HC-SR04 Sonar Sensor** (for detecting the rate of change of distance)  
- **LM393 IR Sensor Module** (for measuring the car’s speed)  
- **L298N Motor Driver Module** (for speed control)  
- **DC Motor & Wheels** (for motion simulation)  
- **Power Supply**

## 📥 Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Dhiyanesh-B/Drive-Sense.git
   cd drive-sense
   ```
2. Connect the Arduino board with computer using Arduino IDE(if not installed install it [click here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/))
3. Upload the code to the arduino
4. and you can run it.
